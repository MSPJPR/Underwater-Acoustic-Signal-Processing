Objective

This project is a web-based interactive application for simulating and visualizing key concepts related to Underwater Acoustic Signal Processing. It allows users to generate ambient noise, calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and simulate beamforming, providing a hands-on approach to understanding complex underwater acoustics phenomena.

Features

1. Ambient Noise Simulation:

Generate a visual representation of ambient noise on a canvas.

Download the generated noise data as a .png image for further analysis.



2. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Calculation:

Allows users to input signal power and noise power via sliders.

Calculates the SNR in real-time and displays the result.



3. Beamforming Simulation:

Visualize basic beamforming patterns on a canvas.

Shows the beam direction and signal paths to understand beamforming concepts.



4. User Interface:

Clean, modern, and responsive design.

Easy-to-use controls for adjusting parameters and viewing results.

Interactive buttons and sliders for an engaging user experience.




Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the web page.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For interactivity, simulations, and calculations.

This project demonstrates a practical and visually appealing approach to Underwater Acoustic Signal Processing, making it easier for users to grasp complex concepts through interactive simulations.
